#arpage for automation finish develop work of report&BI page
![ttt](https://github.com/YliuChina/arpage/blob/master/app/fristpage.png?raw=true)
his date range picker component for Bootstrap creates a dropdown menu from which a user can
select a range of dates. I created it while building the UI for [Improvely](http://www.improvely.com), 
which needed a way to select date ranges for reports.

Features include limiting the selectable date range, localizable strings and date formats,
a single date picker mode, optional time picker (for e.g. making appointments or reservations),
and styles that match the default Bootstrap 3 theme.
